## about the project :thinking:
this project simulates an anonymous question and answer forum, which does not require a login to use any functions.

## executing the project :arrow_forward:
the following instructions assume that you have ```npm```, ```node``` and ```nodemon``` installed on your computer. also, this project was made using fedora 33 :)

after downloading the project files and being in its root folder, do it on your terminal:
```
npm install
```
now all project dependencies are installed. To run the application/server, do:
```
nodemon index.js
```
on your browser, open ```localhost:8010/``` and start making questions!
